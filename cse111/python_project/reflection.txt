Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
Answer: functions are very good are they help break work down into smaller parts 
and its helpful when debugging too, cause one can easily debug when there are but few lines 
of code. It has helped me always when writing programms and assignments, especially when
a program involves calculations. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Ans: The value of test function is to check if your functions are working correctly.
And if its not working corretcly it shows and tell the particular line of 
code that needs to be fixed in the program and we do well in fixing it.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Ans: We where taught that the degugger in VS code is a very useful tool for 
debugging errors in code. I would say using the debugger is a great way to do that.
Also python give the advange of specifying the line in the code that have the error, 
so if this is coming from a function, it will tell us the line in the terminal, 
and if we are calling our function into the main function, python will also tell 
us too and what line of code the error
is coming from.
